**Your best friend in credential reuse attacks.**

Cr3dOv3r simply you give it an email then it does two simple jobs (but useful) :
- Search for public leaks for the email and if there's any, it returns with all available details about the leak (Using hacked-emails site API and now haveibeenpwned API too).
- Now you give it this email's old or leaked password then it checks this credentials against 13 websites of well-known websites (ex: facebook, twitter, google...) then it tells you if login successful in any website!

### Some of the scenarios Cr3dOv3r can be used in it
- Searching for a targeted-email for leaks and then use the leaked password to check it against the websites.
- Testing an email and an old password you found on the websites.
- You got a target email and password and want to check if he uses the same password on other websites.
